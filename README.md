# 👋 you welcome brooo

#🌟😁our task here is to create a web that connects event makers/organizers of open events. Well, as we know, many organizations hold open events but are constrained by the spread of information that hasn't been conveyed, because as we know, information is everywhere and that causes event info to be buried/overwritten. so our task is to create a web that allows people who access our web to get event info beyond their reach/surroundings, even if they don't leave the house at all, aka nolep. hahaha😹

#so don't say that's an excuse for noleps not to take part in outside events. hahaha😹
